## Personal Website
#### Had a lot of fun working on this project. Although I don't hold a certification in HTML or CSS I do have the knowledge from previous courses taken to implent the scripts and know how to debug and edit.
In this project, I worked in team with a friend of mine that help me to understand and implement the bootstrap framework and Javascript, and I learned a lot from it.
